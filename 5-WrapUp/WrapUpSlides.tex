\subsection{Manual of Best Practices}
 \begin{frame}{Manual of Best Practices}
 Our goal:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item
 Detailed hands-on how-to manual for transparent social science research. 
 \item 
 Cover all aspects of a transparent research project, from beginning (study design, hypothesis registration) to end (publication, data sharing).
 \item 
 Keep the manual updated.
 \item
 Encourage participation from the community. \url{http://github.com/garretchristensen}
 \item 
 Extend into short textbook.
 \end{itemize}
\end{frame} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsubsection*{Registrations}
\begin{frame}{Registration}
Registration as Solution to Publication Bias:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item
   Publicly stating all research you will do, what hypotheses you will test, prospectively.
   %\item If we know every hypothesis test that is run on a given subject, we have a better idea of how seriously to take the significant results.
  \item
   Near universal adoption in medical RCTs. Top journals (ICMJE) won't publish if it's not registered. \url{http://clinicaltrials.gov}
  \item
   Even better if registry requires outcomes from after study. Currently limited, but NIH is moving on this.
   \item Newer to social sciences, but:
   \begin{itemize}[<.->]
   \item
   	AEA registry, currently only for RCTs. \url{http://socialscienceregistry.org}
   \item
    EGAP registry \url{http://egap.org/design-registration}
   \item 
    3ie registry, for developing country evaluations. \url{http://ridie.3ieimpact.org}
   \item
   	Open Science Framework\\ \url{http://osf.io}
   \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{P-Hacking}
\begin{frame}[<.->]{P-Hacking}
Define the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Also called fishing, researcher degrees of freedom, or data-mining.
\item
Definition: flexibility in data analysis allows portrayal of \textit{anything} as below an arbitrary p-value threshhold; significance loses its meaning.
\item
Not something only evil people do. It's subconcious, or simply built into statistics (Gelman, Loken 2013).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsubsection*{Pre-Analysis Plan}
\begin{frame}{Pre-Analysis Plan}
Explain the solution:
\begin{itemize}
\item
From 3ie: ``A pre-analysis plan is a detailed description of the analysis to be conducted that is written in advance of seeing the data on impacts of the program being evaluated. It may specify hypotheses to be tested, variable construction, equations to be estimated, controls to be used, and other aspects of the analysis. A key function of the pre-analysis plan is to increase transparency in the research. By setting out the details in advance of what will be done and before knowing the results, the plan guards against data mining and specification searching. Researchers are encouraged to develop and upload such a plan with their study registration, but it is not required for registration.''
